# Powershell Scripts for SysAdmins
 
Here you will find a collection of my Powershell scripts that I made to make my job easier, and automate as many tedious tasks as I possibly can.

## Installation

In order to run these scripts, you can clone the repository to a directory of your choice, and then simply open Powershell with elevated privileges, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and then run `.\scriptname.ps1`.

## Usage

The scripts are used to automate your daily IT tasks as a systems administrator, making your life easier.
